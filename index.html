        <h3>1- Development of TMC742 Single Board Computer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overview:</strong> The TMC742 Single Board Computer is a high-performance computing device designed for advanced industrial applications. 
                It features two main parts: a Controller Unit based on an STM32 microprocessor 
                and an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) Unit based on an NXP i.MX processor. 
                This setup provides both robust control capabilities and user-friendly interaction, supporting complex automation tasks.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Controller Unit:</strong> Designed for motor control, sensor readings and real-time operations.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Firmware Development:</strong> Crafted in C for bare metal implementation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peripherals:</strong> Integrated multiple components including four ADCs, a DAC, RS232, RS485, SPI, I2C, 24 volt I/Os, a Servo Motor Drive and an Encoder reader unit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Display Unit:</strong> Allows operators to easily configure system settings and monitor operational data, enhancing control and efficiency.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Developed a custom embedded system using Yocto, which included configuring u-boot, the kernel and the filesystem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peripherals:</strong> Incorporated a 7-inch TFT display, touchscreen, Ethernet, USB and RS232.</li>
                    <li><strong>GUI:</strong> Developed multiple user interfaces for various applications using C++ and Qt, enhancing functionality and user interaction.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This device is built for high performance and versatility, specifically designed for industrial material testing systems. 
            It has significantly enhanced system reliability and increased productivity, 
            showing clear improvements in operational efficiency across various industrial environments.</p>
