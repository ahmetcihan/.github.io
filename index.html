        <h3>1- TMC742 Industrial Controller</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overview:</strong> TMC742 is a high-performance computing device designed for advanced industrial applications. 
                It features two main parts: a Controller Unit based on an STM32 microprocessor 
                and an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) Unit based on an NXP i.MX processor. 
                This setup provides both robust control capabilities and user-friendly interaction, supporting complex automation tasks.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Controller Unit:</strong> Designed for motor control, sensor readings and real-time operations.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Firmware Development:</strong> Crafted in C for bare metal implementation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peripherals:</strong> Integrated multiple components including four ADCs, a DAC, RS232, RS485, SPI, I2C, 24 volt I/Os, a Servo Motor Drive and an Encoder reader unit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Display Unit:</strong> Allows operators to easily configure system settings and monitor operational data, enhancing control and efficiency.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Developed a custom embedded system using Yocto, which included configuring u-boot, the kernel and the filesystem.</li>
